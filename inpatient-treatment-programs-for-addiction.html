These centers often cater to a range of needs, including detoxification, inpatient programs, outpatient services, and counseling.  One should also consider the facility's philosophy of care.  Some facilities specialize in addressing addictions to specific substances, such as opioids, alcohol, or stimulants, while others offer generalized programs covering a broader range of substance use disorders.  <br><br>  Some centers also offer medication to alleviate withdrawal symptoms, allowing individuals to focus on the next stages of their recovery.
